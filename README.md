Minetest-Blockiverse
====================

Mine blocks. Craft stuff. Build spaceship. To lightspeed and beyond!

Place and remove blocks to survive the night, then build a spaceship to explore the vast beyond.

This project is an open source game similar in gameplay to the very popular Mojang (now M$) game. I figured it was time to make an open source alternative and lose the shackles of proprietary code thus allowing any future mod and plugin community to thrive without fear of takeovers like has actually just happened with the Mojang (now M$) game.

The current choice of language/engine is Minetest 1.4.10 engine and lua scripting used as a base to add the blockiverse component.
